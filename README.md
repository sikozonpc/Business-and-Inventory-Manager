# Business and Inventory Manager
A Simple Management app for diffrent types of businesses with a good inventory management system made in C# with WPF using the MVVM Pattern.
I've used SQLite as the main database.


> The Main window , the Dashboard , is the hub for all other tabs. This is an example of custom dashboard. However, when the user
creates an account its auto-generates the necessary tabs for his business model.

> The home is first page in the activity window, but this GUI changes according to the user business model, this one is for a Sole Trader type of company.

# The process
With this app I was aiming to learn WPF and perfect my XAML skills ( since I've worked with XAML in my Xamarin Android project). However , I ended up spending a lot more time than I was expecting, but it's a good thing because I learnt SQLite, DataBindings , MVVM ( even tho I didn't apllied here) and many other things that made myself a better programmer, of course that there is still some erros and TODO's that I'am aware of , but all in all this app is the most complex I've done.
